# Labs_QuadRemesher_Linux

Unofficial QuadRemesher HDA for Linux based on Labs_QuadRemesher HDA from SideFX Labs.  
(https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs)

1.Requirements  
This requires Wine to be installed on your system.  
It's only tested under Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS and Wine 5.0.  
*Wine needs to associate the root directory "/" as "z:" drive in the setting. This is default for Wine, but it's recommended to double check via winecfg.

2.Installation  
Place this HDA under your HDA directory.  
The QuadRemesher Engine will be downloaded in /Exoside directory under your Houdini home directory when the Lincense Manager launches for the first time.

The original idea is from the unofficial QuadRemesher addon for Blender in Linux.
