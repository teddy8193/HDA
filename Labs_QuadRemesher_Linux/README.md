# Labs_QuadRemesher_Linux

Unofficial QuadRemesher HDA for Linux based on Labs_QuadRemesher HDA from SideFX Labs.  
(https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs)

1.Requirements  
Wine needs to be installed on your system.  

2.Installation  
Place this HDA under your HDA directory.  
The QuadRemesher Engine will be downloaded in /Exoside directory under your Houdini home directory when the Lincense Manager launches for the first time.

3.Important notice  
It's only tested under Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS and Wine 5.0. (It could work with older versions.)  
Root directory "/" needs to be mappes as "z:" drive in the Wine's setting. This is default for Wine, but it's recommended to double check via winecfg.

The original idea is from the unofficial QuadRemesher addon for Blender in Linux.
